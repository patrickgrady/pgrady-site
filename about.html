Most recently exploring his passion for design systems as they relate to enterprise-level software as UI Design Manager for <a href="http://www.centro.net/" target="_blank">Centro</a>.

  <h6>Colophon</h6>

  <p>This site was typeset in <i>(the excellent!)</i> Tiempos Headline and Text by <a href="https://klim.co.nz/blog/tiempos-design-information/" target="_blank">Klim Type Foundry</a>. It was built with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>, and hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">Github Pages</a>. <a href="http://gulpjs.com/" target="_blank">Gulp</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass" target="_blank">Node-Sass</a>, and <a href="https://www.browsersync.io/" target="_blank">Browsersync</a> were used to create a quick-compiling build script that includes live updates on multiple devices. See the Project Starter Kit below for a look under the hood, it installs <a href="http://breakpoint-sass.com/" target="_blank">Breakpoint</a> and <a href="https://github.com/modularscale/modularscale-sass" target="_blank">Modular Scale</a> without the need for&nbsp;Compass. Check out the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/style-guide">style guide</a>.</p>
