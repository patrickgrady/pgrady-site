  <h6>Bio</h6>
  <p>This is the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/style-guide/">Style Guide</a>. As an Avenger, Stark would go on to participate in many missions over the years, although he sometimes had trouble reconciling his private affairs with his responsibilities in the Avengers.[24] With the other remaining founders after the Hulk left,[23] he was among those who discovered the frozen form of the heroic Captain America, still frozen since World War II.[25] He was also the Avenger who sponsored the membership of Hawkeye, a man whom he had skirmished with, after realizing his good intentions. Hawkeye was one of the new Avengers who joined when Stark and the other founders decided to take leaves of absence.[26]</p>

  <h6>Colophon</h6>
  <p>Over the years Stark constantly refined and modified the design of his armor. From a bulky, transistorized iron suit, he eventually built a relatively lightweight, integrated circuit, magnetically-polarized suit with more human-looking articulated musculature.[18] Stark's extraordinary genius in theoretical mechanics has enabled him to keep his suit of armor state-of-the-art. Stark eventually underwent heart transplant surgery so that he was no longer obligated to wear his metallic chest plate.[27]</p>
