  <h6>The Brief</h6>

  <p>In the fall of 2013 the team at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia could see that <i>half</i> of their site traffic was coming from mobile devices so they began lobbying for a mobile-first redesign. They needed a experienced partner, and because my firm had recently worked on some similar projects, we were chosen to develop their new CMS and responsive design system.</p>

  <h6>The Process</h6>
  <p>We kicked off the project with a week of onsite discovery meetings where we gather as much information as possible about what the client is hoping to achieve so we can ensure a good outcome. Toward this end we collaborate on activities such as <i>I Like, I Wish, I Wonder&#8230;</i> that helps identify pain-points and gaps in the current system, and some nice-to-have’s for the new one. Throughout the week we do other similar activities to further narrow in on project goals and level-set expectations. Inclusiveness is the key during this process so all parties feel consulted, and comfortable about the direction the project.</p>

<div class="measure">
  <p>One of the biggest takeaways from our meetings with the CHOP team was that they very much wanted to be trained up in our tools, processes, and techniques to maintain and expand the site after we parted ways. So we thought it would be a good idea for their interactive design manager and me to co-locate for a week early on. This way we could collaborate to get the ball rolling, and he would learn how to approach design in a modular and systematic way suited to large responsive sites. He could then transfer that experience to his own team later on once the project had gained some momentum.</p>

  <p>As other teams focused on a content survey and  the big buckets that would become the major sections of the site, we began identifying content types and page templates. This took the form of a lot of whiteboard sketches which start from lists of the most important information that describe a specific piece of content like a location, doctor, or conditon.</p>

  <p>After a few pages began to take shape we could identify things that were being repeated, or components, and use them to create additional pages. The sketches were then refined and combined into more general templates that would form the basis of the new&nbsp;site.</p>

  <p>Next the sketches were firmed up into wireframes with a static design tool. The goal here was to be visually rough and fast, but with enough detailed information to communicate important ideas, facilitate conversations, and to get the go-ahead for design and development.</p>

  <p>At about the same time as the wireframes I was beginning to explore some ideas for visual look-and-feel. I used a technique called a style tile which combines a logo, some colors, photos, and type into a format that doesn't resemble a web page. This is a great way to get buy-in on a design direction without getting mired in hypothetical details. I chose hopeful inspiring photos, bright electric colors with a main hue reminiscent of hospital scrubs, and a modern playful type-pairing.</p>

<div class="measure">
  <p>From here I created the core set of templates in the browser with HTML and Sass. The templates I chose to start with were the homepage, general page, a few unique but related landing pages, and a search results page. Once the templates were done I worked up a quick style guide that showed many of the components extracted from the template. As it turns out, being able to see the parts and pieces that make up the site in isolation helped them better understand how to recombine components to create new pages once they were on their own &mdash; one of their top success metrics!</p>
