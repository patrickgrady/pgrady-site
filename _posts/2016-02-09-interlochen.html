  <h6>The Brief</h6>

  <p>Near the end of 2012 the Interlochen team began think about upgrading to the newest version of the Drupal CMS. Since my company had worked with them last time we were chosen to consult again. As an added value we recommended they invest in a responsive design for a more sustainable, future-ready website.</p>

  <h6>The Process</h6>

  <p>We began the project by traveling to Interlochen, Michigan for a few days of discovery. While there we assessed needs and developed an overall approach to the project together with our new clients. As the project’s designer, I gave an overview of RWD’s benefits and current limitations since it was still relatively early on in its adoption.</p>

  <p>In addition to meeting our future teammates, the discovery sessions are also a great time to get a sense of an organization’s values and sensibilities, and how that bubbles through to their brand. In the case of Interlochen, it’s physical location in the heart of the Michigan woods left a deep impression on me.</p>

  <p>After discovery I began creating style tiles to communicate look-and-feel of some different design directions. The beautiful woods of Interlochen inspired me to create a color palette with tree bark hues paired with imagery of the outdoor campus, students, and their artwork — which was the option that we ended up moving forward with.</p>

  <p>Next page templates were identified, and I used the chosen design direction to inform me as I began iterating with the client on a static page. As things began to firm up I started coding a number of the page templates. This approach let me define the site’s styles and responsive behavior precisely, and also gave us head start on development.</p>

  <h6>The Result</h6>

  <p>Below are some sample screens of the page templates that were created for the Interlochen redesign.</p>
