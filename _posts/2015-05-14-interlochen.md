<p>The staff at Augustana were looking for a website that could excel as an admissions tool as well as serve their more functional needs. To do this the site would need to be both clearly organized and designed in a way that was appealing to current and prospective students, but not a barrier to their parents. To that end, parallax scrolling technique was used on the homepage and landing pages, but not on general page. The Jekyll-powered style guide documents each and every component of the fully-responsive design system.</p>
